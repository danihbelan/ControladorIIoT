                      TAME V4.3.1 Release Notes 
                      -------------------------

- Bugfix: Error with user defined data types in SumRequests fixed. Arrays
  and structures were overwritten with the user defined type. Minor error
  with data type STRING fixed.




                       TAME V4.3 Release Notes 
                       -----------------------

- Changed file names: For providing an NPM module I decided to rename the 
  files to the common standart:

    old                     new
    -----------             --------------
    tame-w-comments.js      tame.js
    tame.js                 tame.min.js

  So tame.js is now the readable version and tame.min.js is the minified one.

- Bugfix: Minor errors fixed.



  
                       TAME V4.2 Release Notes 
                       -----------------------

- New feature: Data type INT2DP added (INT in PLC, number with 2 decimal
  points in JavaScript.

- New feature: Code and files for using TAME as an NPM module added.




                      TAME V4.1.2 Release Notes 
                      -------------------------

- Bugfix: 3 syntax errors fixed (commas deleted, thanks to Jouzer for
  reporting).




                      TAME V4.1.1 Release Notes 
                      -------------------------

- Bugfix: The TPY file generated by TwinCAT 3 can contain data types with
  no type information (especially if OSCAT is used). The parser stopped
  there with an error. Now there will be just a message logged in the 
  console.
  
- New feature: There is a new example using SVG graphics. Thanks to Niels
  Linnemann for providing this example.
  



                       TAME V4.1 Release Notes 
                       -----------------------
                      
- New feature: For better error handling there is now an on-error function.
  Usage is similar to the on-complete function. It fires on ADS-, XML- and
  network errors.
  
- New feature: Timeout for XMLHttpRequest added. The default value is set to
  5000 ms. You can change the value by overwriting the "xmlHttpReqTimeout"
  property of the client.
  
- New feature: There are missing data types in some TwinCAT libraries. By 
  default TAME drops an error and stops importing the data types from the TPY
  file. With the new client parameter "skipMissingTypes" set to true it will 
  just drop a message an continue parsing the file.

  
                      
                      
                      TAME V4.0.1 Release Notes 
                      -------------------------

- Bugfix: The onReady function was not executed under iOS, fixed.




                       TAME V4.0 Release Notes 
                       -----------------------

- Changed API: Synchronous XMLHttpRequest outside of workers is in the process 
  of being removed from the web platform and it's already deprecated in most
  browsers. TAME has been used synchronous requests for building the symbol
  table. With asynchronous requests became a new "onReady" property nessecary 
  and the process of starting the client is different to V3.x. 
  
  !!! If you want to replace V3.x with V4 you have to change the way of starting
  your scripts !!!

- New feature: Handles are supported now. There are functions for getting and
  releasing handles as well as for logging them to the JavaScript console.
  TwinCAT 2.11 >= Build 1550 is needed to use this feature.
  
- Bugfix: User and password were not used for fetching the TPY file, fixed.

 


                       TAME V3.5 Release Notes 
                       -----------------------

- New feature: Using the *.tpy file generated by TwinCAT it's now possible to 
  access single elements of structures and arrays and also internal variables
  and parameters of FB's. Structure definitions are built automatically if no 
  definition is provided by user. Target information like NetId and port can be
  read from the file, it's no longer necessary to set them manually.
  
- New feature: Just like the symbol table, the data type information can be
  im-/exported from/to a JSON string. Especially intented for Tasker scripts.
 
- Changed API: New client parameter "configFileUrl". The path to the *.tpy file
  on the webserver.
  
- Changed API: New client parameter "forceUploadUsage". Skips building the
  symbol table from the data of the *.tpy file and use the Upload instead.

  
  

                       TAME V3.4 Release Notes 
                       ------------------------

- Some changes made for TwinCAT 3 compatibility (symbol table, alignment).

- Changed API: The client parameter "dataAlign4" is depricated, for setting the
  value for the data alignment there is now a new parameter named "alignment".
  
- Bugfix: LREAL values were written with 16 bytes length, fixed.

- Bugfix: The "SP" parameter was not recognized if structures were written with
  a SumWriteRequest, fixed.




                       TAME V3.3 Release Notes 
                       ------------------------

- Minor impovements.




                       TAME V3.2 Release Notes 
                       ------------------------
                       
- New feature: Values for writing TOD variables can be a string now, i.e. "21:32".

- New feature: Function "readAdsState()" added for checking the current state of PLC 
  (run/stop).

- New feature: Authentication added.

- More error messages.




                       TAME V3.1 Release Notes 
                       -----------------------
                       
- New feature: Methods for importing/exporting the symbol table from/to a JSON
  string added. Especially intented for Tasker scripts (Android).

- Changed API: For a better understanding I changed the name of the parameter
  for preventing the use of the Upload for building the symbol table.

    old             new
    -----------     --------------
    dontReadUpload  dontFetchSymbols
    
- Bugfix: Variables of a SumReadRequest defined after a structure or an array
  were not updated, fixed.
    
- Some code improvements and Strict Mode added.


 

                       TAME V3.1b2 Release Notes 
                       -------------------------

  intented for Tasker scripts (Android).




                       TAME V3.1b Release Notes 
                       -------------------------
                       
- New feature: The SumReadReq supports arrays and structures now.           




                       TAME V3.0 Release Notes 
                       -------------------------
                       
- Bugfix: Fixed a problem with "readReq()" using addressed items.                 
                       
                       
                       
                       
                       TAME V3.0b2 Release Notes 
                       -------------------------


- Changed API: The name of the parameter for preventing the use of the
  Upload for building the symbol table has changed.

    old             new
    -----------     --------------
    useUploadInfo   dontReadUpload




                       TAME V3.0b Release Notes 
                       ------------------------
                       
                       
- New feature: Access to PLC variables by name is now possible. Internally 
  IndexGroup/IndexOffset is used instead of handles, so a visualisation
  has to be reloaded in the browser when the PLC program has changed.
  
- New feature: Multiple PLC variables can be read by a SumReadRequest. The 
  advantage over the standart ReadRequest is that variables don't have to be
  located. TwinCAT V2.10 Build >= 1324 is needed to use this feature!
  




                       TAME V2.2.2 Release Notes

                       TAME V2.2 Release Notes 
                       -----------------------
                       
                       
- New feature: Support for data type LREAL added (thanks to Martin Geiger for the preliminary work).

                       TAME V2.1 Release Notes 
                       -----------------------


- New feature: All numeric data types and the data type TIME with bounds
  checking now. Added a new Webservice Client property "useCheckBounds",
  which is set to "true" by default.

- Bugfix: Some issues with writing of REAL variables fixed.

                       TAME V2.0 Release Notes
                       -----------------------


- Improved performance due to a complete redesign and a lot of micro-
  optimizations.

- More and improved debug messages.

- New examples.

- New feature: For the methods "writeArray" and "writeArrayOfStruct": 
  With the parameter "item" set to the index number of an array item,
  only this item of the array is written to the PLC. So there's no need to 
  write the whole array or calculating the address of the item by yourself,
  if one want's to write one element only.

- New feature: For reading/writing structures it's now possible to define 
  arrays as a type in structures, i.e. ARRAY.20.STRING.11 for an array of 
  20 string variables, each with 11 characters length.

- New feature: Instead of defining the field "fld" and the address as a number
  in the request descriptor, the address can now be written like the address
  in the PLC: 
  
    addr: "%MB23"
    addr: "%MW100"
    addr: "%MX0.1"
    
  Although the old notation is still supported, it's deprecated and should
  not be used anymore.

- New feature: The WebServiceClient has an additonal property "language" for 
  setting the language of names of days and months, used for the formatted 
  output of dates. 
  Defaults to german (ge).

- Changed API: The name of the parameter for reading variables defined in a 
  direct sequence has changed (method "readReq").

    old         new
    ----------- ------------
    cont        seq

- Changed API: The item list of a request descriptor has to be an array now,
  the alternative use of an object literal has been removed. The name of
  the property has also changed:
  
    old         new
    ----------- ------------
    varlist     items
    
- Changed API: Renamed paramters for creating the Webservice Client:

    - Changed call: TAME.WebServiceClient.createClient

    - Changed parameter:
    
        old         new
        ----------- -----------
        url         serviceUrl
        netId       amsNetId
        port        amsPort
        dataAlignm  dataAlign4

- Changed API: For the methods "readString/writeString" and "readArrayOfString/
  writeArrayOfString" the parameter for the length of the string has changed.
  
    old         new
    ----------- ------------
    len         strlen

- Bugfix: Acknowledgement counter was broken, fixed.

- Bugfix: Upper limts for SINT, INT and DINT were wrong, fixed.

- Various minor fixes and improvements.
